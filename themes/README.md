# Themes
This directory contains DreamCSS's themes.

### Usage
After you include DreamCSS in your page, you can also include themes.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="path/to/theme.css">
```

To use themes without downloading them, point the source to jsDelivr.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/MystPi/dreamcss/themes/theme.css">
```
